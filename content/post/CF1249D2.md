# Solution

The greedy approach is: iterate from left to right, whenever we find a point covered by more than $k$ segments, we should remove the segment which covers this point and its right end is maximum.

In order to achieve our approach, we need an array $open_i$ which stores the segments that start at point $i$ and an array $close_i$ which says the ending segments. We also need to maintain the set of segments that cover the current point, and a `priority_queue` to help us find the segment with the maximum right end point.

More specifically, for each point, we first insert the segments that start at this point and then find segments that should be removed and remove them. Last we remove segments that is closed at this point.

# Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

#define F first
#define S second
#define endl '\n'
using namespace std;

const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;

const int N=2e5+5;
vector<pii> open[N];
vector<int> close[N];

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    int n,k;
    cin>>n>>k;
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
        int l,r;
        cin>>l>>r;
        close[r].emplace_back(i);
        open[l].emplace_back(r,i);
    }
    set<int> now;
    vector<int> ans;
    priority_queue<pii> pq;
    for(int i=1;i<=N-1;i++){
        for(auto it:open[i]){
            now.insert(it.S);
            pq.push(it);
        }
        while(now.size()>k){
            pii tmp=pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            now.erase(tmp.S);
            ans.emplace_back(tmp.S);
        }
        for(int x:close[i]){
            now.erase(x);
        }
    }
    cout<<ans.size()<<endl;
    for(int it:ans) cout<<it<<' ';
    return 0;
}
```
