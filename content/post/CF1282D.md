# Solution

First, we could find the number of 'a' and 'b' by using two strings consisting 300 'a's and 300 'b's. Then we got $num_a=q_a$ and $q_b$ and the number of 'a' is $300-q_a$ and the number of 'b' is $num_b=300-q_b$ thus the length of the answer $len$ is simply their sum.

Let the answer be filled with 'a' first. If we replace any digit with 'b' and query, we will get either $num_b-1$ or $num_b+1$. If we get $num_b-1$ that means that digit should be 'b' otherwise it should be 'a'. Do the procedure above for every digits and we are almost done.

Note that we used $n+3$ queries which exceeds the limits but the query for the last digit is unnecessary since we could use the previous queries to know the last digit.
