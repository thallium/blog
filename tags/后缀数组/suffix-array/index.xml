      <description>看了两天才看明白这别人的代码 Solution Consider the contribution to the answer of the each occurrence of each substring. Suppose this substring has appeared $c$ times. For a new occurrence of this substring, the answer would change from $c^2$ to $(c+1)^2$, that is to say, each new occurrence contributes $(c+1)^2-c^2=2\cdot c+1$ to the answer. Since there are $\dfrac {n\cdot (n+1)} 2$ substrings, the answer is at least $\dfrac {n\cdot (n+1)} 2$ , now what we left is to focusing on finding the occurrence of the substrings. You will see why it&amp;rsquo;s</description>
