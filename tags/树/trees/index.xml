      <description>这跟暴力又有什么区别呢？ Solution( based on the official editorial) Intersections can be found with sweep line approach (store the endpoints of each segment and its index, sort the array and iterate over it).We need to maintain a set of the endpoints of the open segments. When we add a segment, we iterate over the open segments ad find segments which end earlier than it. It looks like brute force,right? but we don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about TLE since we will stop when the number of intersection is greater than $n-1$. In</description>

      <description>好题！ Solution The solution consists of two DFS, first DFS is to calculate $sub_i$: the max difference of the subgraph in subtree of $i$. Note that we treat the graph as a rooted tree, so the subtree means the part that is lower than node $i$. This is pretty naive DFS. The second dfs is to find the answer of each vertex. Since we only considered the contribution of the subtree, we need to add the contribution of other part the graph. How to find this contribution? We always get the answer of higher nodes first. Let $v$</description>
